// Types of data types 

// String: Represents text data.
// Number: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers using a 64-bit format. This includes special values like Infinity and NaN.
// Boolean: Represents true or false for logical operations.
// Undefined: Indicates a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
// Null: Represents the intentional absence of an object value, assigned explicitly. typeof null is "object", which is a historical issue.
// Symbol: A unique and immutable value used as object property identifiers.
// BigInt: Represents integers of arbitrary size, larger than the standard Number type.
